Cascadence is built on [Micronucleus](https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus) which is a USB bootloader for attiny microcontrollers.

I recommend you pull the latest release and flash the precompiled t84_default configuration (we're using Attiny84 here). I have uploaded them here for reference.
